# House Price Prediction

This project predicts house prices using various regression models based on multiple features such as location, area, BHK, and more.  
The goal is to build an end-to-end ML pipeline for house price estimation using real-world housing data scraped from the web.

## ⚙️ How to Run

1. **Clone this repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/house-price-prediction.git
   cd house-price-prediction
````

2. **Create a virtual environment** (optional but recommended)

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # For Linux/Mac
   venv\Scripts\activate     # For Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Run the notebook**

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook House_Price_Prediction.ipynb
   ```

   Python version used: **3.11.9**

## ⚠️ Model File

> **Note:**
> The trained model `pipeline.pkl` is **not included** in this repository due to GitHub's file size limit.
> You can **retrain the model** by running the notebook end-to-end.
